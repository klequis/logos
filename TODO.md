## Prime
- the skills section doesn't look good on mobile. As an alternative could put the devices across the top and then have the logos below. The change may be as easy as changing 'flexDirection'?

## Current
- finalize logos in Software Developer
- Remove "Software Developer" from header of logo section
- repeat header logos in footer
- remove email from footer
- setup route 52





## About me - Maybe Not ?
Write something about myself
- skills - or do logos
- experienced software developer with strong / current JavaScript, ecosystem, something
